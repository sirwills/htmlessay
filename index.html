    <P>My name is Odali Wills. I am student and currently running a Fullstack JavaScript cousre at GOMYCODE Nigeria.
         </P>
         <p>It has been a worthwhile learning process here at GOMYCODE Nigeria, as i have learnt a hanfull of skill set starting from introduction to Web fundamentals which simply explains what the web is and how it works.
            Recently, i just concluded another skill called Git and GitHub where I learnt about the difference between Git and GitHub. i also learnt about the advantages of using Git and GitHub as a Web Developer. </p>
            <p>As a show of the skills sets I have learnt, I would love to show you to my <a href="https://github.com/sirwills" target="blank">GitHub profile.</a> You could also check out my first <a href="https://github.com/sirwills/website" target="blank">Repository</a> i created on GitHub. </p>
